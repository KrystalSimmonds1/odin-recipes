    <h3>Chicken and Tarragon Poached Yolk Stuffed Ravioli</h3>

    <p>We love this recipe so much, that we thought we would re-post 
        it today. We have pasta on our minds these days, and these yolk 
        stuffed raviolis are one of our favorite DIY pasta recipes we 
        have on out blog. These raviolis are a bit of work to make, 
        but totally worth it. The yolks are still runny after you cook 
        them, which makes them kind of create their own sauce after you 
        dig in, which is so delicious with all the brown butter we also 
        slathered on. :)</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <h3>Chicken and tarragon filling</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>8 ounces part skim ricotta</li>
            <li>2 ounces mascarpone, softened</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons grated Parmesan</li>
            <li>⅔ cup cooked and shredded chicken</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon minced tarragon</li>
            <li>1 charred ear of corn</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Assembly</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Pasta dough</li>
            <li>1 large egg plus 1 tablespoon water, beaten together</li>
            <li>8 large egg yolks</li>
            <li>½ cup (1 stick) unsalted butter</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>Parmesan, for garnish</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Place all filling ingredients into a mixing bowl and mix together until completely combined. Cover and refrigerate until ready to use.</li>

            <li>Lightly flour a clean surface and roll the pasta dough until ⅛” thick.</li>

            <li>Cut eight, 4”x 6” rectangles out of the dough and lightly brush each surface with the egg and water mixture (egg wash).</li>

            <li>Place about 3 tablespoons of filling onto 1 side of each pasta rectangle, leaving a ½” border.</li>

            <li>Create a small divot in the center of the filling and carefully place 1 yolk into each divot.</li>

            <li>Carefully fold the other side of the pasta rectangles over the yolk and filling and gently press the edges, making sure to get rid of any air bubbles.</li>

            <li>Using a large circle cutter, carefully cut the pasta squares into circles and firmly press down to seal.</li>

            <li>Fill a large pot with water and bring to a boil. Add a handful of salt to the water and add the raviolis. Boil for 5 to 6 minutes.</li>

            <li>While the raviolis boil, melt the butter in a skillet, over medium heat. Continue to cook butter until it begins to brown and release a nutty aroma.</li>

            <li>Reduce the heat to medium-low and using a slotted spoon transfer the ravioli to the skillet with browned butter. Sauté raviolis for about 2 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.</li>

            <li>Transfer ravioli onto a platter and pour browned butter over the top. Finish with freshly grated Parmesan and serve immediately.</li>
