    <p>Toscana is celebrated for a rustic cuisine that showcases

        for handcrafted pasta ribbons cooked in a wild-mushroom ragù.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>1 pound pappardelle</li>
            <li>1 pound mixed mushrooms (such as porcini, cremini, 
                oyster, shiitake or maitake), stems removed & sliced</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>1 medium Spanish onion, finely chopped</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, finely chopped</li>
            <li>2 cloves of garlic, minced</li>
            <li>½ cup dry white wine</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons thyme, freshly chopped</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons parsley, chopped</li>
            <li>Salt & freshly-ground black pepper, to taste</li>
            <li>Parmigiano Reggiano, freshly grated, for serving</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>In a 12-14-inch sauté pan, heat the extra virgin 
                olive oil over high heat until it is smoking. 
                Add the chopped onion and garlic and cook them over 
                high heat for 5 minutes, until the onions are a light 
                golden brown. Add the chopped mushrooms, and continue 
                cooking until they have given up most of their water, 
                about 9-10 minutes. Add the wine, thyme, salt, and 
                pepper, to taste, then reduce the heat to medium. 
                Cook the sauce for 5 more minutes, until the mixture 
                is of a ragù consistency.</li>

            <li>Bring 6 quarts of water to a boil, and add 2 tablespoons 
                of salt. Drop the pasta in the pot, and cook it until al 
                dente. Drain the pasta, reserving the cooking water, 
                and add the pasta to the ragù.</li>

            <li>Add the pasta to the pan with the mushroom ragù, and toss. 
                Add the lemon juice and parsley, and toss over high heat 
                for 1 minute to coat the pappardelle evenly, adding a 
                ladleful of pasta water if needed.</li>

            <li>Check the seasoning for salt and pepper, and adjust, 
                if necessary. Divide the pasta evenly among four warmed 
                pasta bowls, top each dish with the freshly-grated 
                Parmigiano Reggiano, and serve immediately.</li>
