    <h3>Spaghetti Carbonara</h3>

    <p>When you're craving a comforting bowl of creamy pasta, 
        nothing will cure you as fast as carbonara. This pasta dish 
        with Roman origins is a sure win, calling for just 5 ingredients 
        (not including salt and oil), and done from start to finish in 
        20 minutes. It’s basically a pantry dive –  spaghetti, bacon, 
        garlic, eggs, and parmesan are all ingredients 
        that are easy to have on hand and don’t spoil fast. 
        As for the creaminess, it’s a misnomer that carbonara is 
        made with cream (more below) – the creaminess comes from the 
        silky parmesan-egg sauce, and it takes a touch of technique 
        to get it right.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <li>
            <ul>Kosher salt</ul>
            <ul>12 oz. spaghetti</ul>
            <ul>3 large eggs</ul>
            <ul>1 cup of grated Parmesan, plus more for serving</ul>
            <ul>8 slices of bacon</ul>
            <ul>2 cloves of garlic, minced</ul>
            <ul>Freshly ground black pepper</ul>
            <ul>Freshly chopped parsley, for garnish</ul>
        </li>

        <h2>Directions</h2>

        <li>
            <ol>In a large pot of boiling salted water, cook pasta until al dente 
                according to package directions. Reserve 1 cup pasta water before 
                draining.</ol>
            <ol>In a medium bowl, whisk eggs and Parmesan until combined.</ol>
            <ol>Meanwhile, in a large skillet over medium heat, cook 
                bacon until crispy, about 8 minutes. Reserve fat in 
                skillet and transfer slices to a paper towel–lined 
                plate to drain. Break into bite-size pieces.</ol>
            <ol>Add garlic to skillet and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. 
                Add cooked pasta and toss until fully coated in bacon fat. 
                Remove from heat. Pour over egg-and-cheese mixture and stir 
                vigorously until creamy (being careful not to scramble eggs). 
                Add pasta water a few tablespoons at a time to loosen sauce.</ol>
            <ol>Season generously with salt and pepper and stir in cooked bacon.</ol>
            <ol>Drizzle with oil and garnish with flaky sea salt 
                (if using), Parmesan, and parsley before serving.</ol>
