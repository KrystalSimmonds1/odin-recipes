        <em>Spaghetti Carbonara</em>

        <p>When you're craving a comforting bowl of creamy pasta, nothing will cure you as fast as carbonara. This pasta dish 
            with Roman origins is a sure win, calling for just 5 ingredients (not including salt and oil), and done from start to finish in 
            20 minutes. It’s basically a pantry dive –  spaghetti, bacon, garlic, eggs, and parmesan are all ingredients that are easy to 
            have on hand and don’t spoil fast. As for the creaminess, it’s a misnomer that carbonara is made with cream (more below) – the creaminess comes from the 
            silky parmesan-egg sauce, and it takes a touch of technique to get it right.</p>

            <h2>Ingredients</h2>

            <ul>
                <li>Kosher salt</li>

                    Remove from heat. Pour over egg-and-cheese mixture and stir 
                    vigorously until creamy (being carefli not to scramble eggs).
